      How RutherCloud transformed a restaurant’s daily operations with a scalable,
      cloud-based management system.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The restaurant was experiencing rapid growth, but its operational processes were still
        heavily dependent on manual systems. Billing was handled manually, orders were written
        on paper, and daily sales tracking was inconsistent. During peak hours, these inefficiencies
        resulted in order mistakes, delayed service, and dissatisfied customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        RutherCloud partnered with the restaurant to design and implement a
        <strong>cloud-based Restaurant Management System</strong> that could centralize billing,
        order management, reporting, and staff operations under one platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary objective was to reduce operational friction, improve accuracy, and give
        restaurant owners real-time visibility into their business performance.
