      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This local retail business was operating entirely offline and relied only on walk-in customers.
Due to the lack of an online presence, the shop was missing potential customers who were searching for products and services online.
RutherCloud partnered with the business to create a digital foundation that would increase visibility, trust, and customer engagement without adding complexity for the owner.

Our goal was to build a simple, fast, and mobile-first website that works as a digital visiting card and lead-generation tool for the shop.
