      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The construction company had a strong offline reputation but lacked a professional
        online presence. Most client enquiries came through word-of-mouth, limiting the
        company’s ability to attract new projects and higher-value clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today’s digital-first market, potential clients often evaluate a construction
        company based on its website before making contact. Without a website, the business
        was losing credibility and missing out on valuable opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        RutherCloud partnered with the company to design a professional, modern website that
        would clearly communicate expertise, showcase completed projects, and generate
        consistent online enquiries.

      <h2>Results Achieved</h2>
      <p>
        After launching the new website, the construction company experienced noticeable
        improvements in visibility and client engagement:
