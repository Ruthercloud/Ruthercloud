    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      Global Machinery is one of the biggest global manufacturers of electronic meters with business units
      across India, Australia and the UK. To modernize their corporate training and e-learning process,
      Ruthercloud developed a fully automated Learning Management System (LMS).
    </p>

    <p>
      This LMS is the backbone of their global training division. It manages everything from Training
      Needs Analysis to complete execution across all business units. The new LMS replaces the company’s
      legacy system with a fresh, modern, automated and intuitive platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system is tightly integrated with their Talent Management and HR System, enabling seamless
      organization-wide training workflows. It is successfully deployed across all global locations and
      supports classroom training, assessments, online e-learning and various skill development programs.
